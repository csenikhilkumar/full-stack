# 📘 NextJS Part 3

This section covers advanced routing and rendering concepts in Next.js, focusing on dynamic routing and hydration.

---

## ✅ What we’ve covered

A summary of all core concepts in Next.js explored so far:

* File-based routing
* Pages and components
* Layouts and navigation
* API routes and server-side logic

---

## 🧽 Route Groups `()`

Route Groups let you group routes without affecting the URL structure.
For example:

```
app/(marketing)/home/page.tsx → /home
app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx → /settings
```

This is helpful for organizing code into different logical areas (e.g., marketing vs. admin).

---

## 🔁 Dynamic Routes `[]`

Dynamic routing in Next.js allows creating routes with variables in the path:

```
pages/post/[id].js → /post/1, /post/2
```

You can access the route parameter via `useRouter()` or `getStaticProps`/`getServerSideProps`.

---

## 🧲 Catch-All Segment `[...param]`

This type of route captures any number of path segments:

```
pages/docs/[...slug].js → /docs/a, /docs/a/b/c
```

It returns the path segments as an array. Useful for building nested documentation pages.

---

## 🔃 Catch-All (Optional) `[[...param]]`

Optional catch-all routes are similar to catch-all, but also match the base route without any params:

```
pages/blog/[[...slug]].js
→ Matches: /blog, /blog/a, /blog/a/b
```

Perfect for pages that should optionally accept dynamic segments.

---

## 🏗 Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG pre-renders pages at build time using `getStaticProps()`.
It ensures fast performance and SEO-friendly pages.
Useful for blogs, portfolios, and marketing sites.

---

## 💧 Hydration

Hydration is the process of attaching React event listeners to HTML generated by the server.
It enables interactivity in pre-rendered pages.
Handled automatically by Next.js after server rendering.
